\textbf{Proposed Title:} Securing the supply chain

\bigbreak
\noindent\textbf{Overview:} Modern software development depends heavily on layers of abstractions such as libraries, frameworks, cloud infrastructure, and source code repositories built and maintained by others. This supply chain is an important attack vector, and several recent incidents, such as the Log4j vulnerability, highlight the scope of the fallout when this vector is exploited. This review is intended to discuss the primary attack vectors in the supply chain, security measures and practices to reduce risk, and a discussion on recent incidents.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Overview of the software supply chain
\item Supply chain attack vectors
\begin{enumerate}
\item Source code repositories
\item Software dependencies
\item Cloud infrastructure
\item Artifact registries
\item Build systems
\end{enumerate}
\item Defending against supply chain attacks - Discussion on modern security frameworks and standards
\item Recent supply chain security incidents such as Log4j and the SolarWinds attack
\end{enumerate}
