The system, called OpenFold3, was developed by the OpenFold Consortium1, a non-profit collaboration of academic and private research groups, headquartered in Davis, California. OpenFold3 uses proteinsâ€™ amino acid sequences to map their 3D structures and model how they interact with other molecules, such as drugs or DNA.
