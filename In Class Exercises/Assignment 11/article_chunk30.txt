Open-source models
OpenFold3 is part of a wider push to develop open-source versions of AlphaFold3. These efforts began in May 2024, when London-based Google DeepMind launched AlphaFold3 without initially sharing its underlying code. Researchers criticized the private firm’s decision — and later, in November 2024, DeepMind made the AlphaFold3 code and model weights, or all the trainable parameters in an AI model, available to academics (they remain unavailable for commercial use).

Late last year, AI researcher Regina Barzilay, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, and her colleagues released a similar open-access model called Boltz2. A second of version of the system, released earlier this year3, predicts protein structures and estimates how strongly they bind to small ligands.
